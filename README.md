## List of Color Names ðŸ”– (**252**)

![List of all Color Names](colors.svg "List of Hindi color names")

You can also view the colors as an [interactive HTML page](colors.html).

## How It Works

This collection is built by scraping color names from Hindi language sources, primarily Wikipedia. The process:

1. Fetches color names and hex values from defined sources
2. Sanitizes the data (removing duplicates, formatting hex values)
3. Generates visualization files (SVG, HTML)
4. Outputs data in multiple formats (JSON, CSV)

## Building the List

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies: `npm ci`
3. Run the build script:
   
```bash
npm run build
```

## Output Files

The build process generates:

- `colors.json` - Full JSON with color data
- `colors.min.json` - Minified JSON version
- `colors.csv` - CSV format with name, hex value, and source link
- `colors.svg` - Visual representation of all colors
- `colors.html` - Interactive HTML page with clickable color names

## Contributing

To add your own color entries, edit the `src/userCreations.csv` file with the format:

```csv
name,hex,link
```

Then run the build script to regenerate all files.
